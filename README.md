# Lung-cancer-single-cell-RNA-SEQ
this repository contains a data pipeline to analyze single cell data. 
The dataset used in this analysis is a **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)** dataset derived from **lung cancer** samples, which likely includes a mixture of tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal cells from various stages of the disease. This type of data provides a detailed snapshot of gene expression at the single-cell level, capturing cellular heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment.

Here are the general aspects of the dataset:

### 1. **Data Format:**
   - The dataset is in the **10X Genomics format**, which includes gene expression matrices in the form of sparse matrices. These matrices represent the expression levels of genes across individual cells.
   - **Features** (rows): Each row corresponds to a specific gene.
   - **Cells** (columns): Each column corresponds to an individual cell.

### 2. **Cell Types:**
   - The dataset may contain various types of cells from the lung cancer microenvironment, including **tumor cells**, **immune cells**, and **stromal cells**. The diversity in cell types is essential for understanding tumor progression, immune response, and the tumor's interaction with surrounding tissues.
   - Some potential cell types include:
     - **Cancer cells** (e.g., tumorigenic lung cells)
     - **Immune cells** (e.g., T cells, macrophages)
     - **Fibroblasts** (stromal cells)
     - **Endothelial cells** (cells of blood vessels)

### 3. **Gene Expression Data:**
   - **Expression levels** of thousands of genes are captured per cell, providing insights into the gene activity of individual cells in response to various environmental signals.
   - Gene expression data is typically sparse, meaning that most genes will have low or zero expression in a given cell.

### 4. **Quality Metrics:**
   - Cells are filtered based on metrics like the total number of features (genes) detected, the percentage of mitochondrial genes, and other quality control factors. These steps are essential to remove low-quality or dead cells and keep only viable, high-quality cells for analysis.

### 5. **Research Questions:**
   - **Tumor heterogeneity**: Understanding the diversity of cell types within the lung cancer samples, including how different cell types may be involved in tumor growth, metastasis, or immune evasion.
   - **Immune response**: Studying the immune cell populations within the tumor and their interaction with cancer cells. This is especially relevant for immunotherapy studies.
   - **Gene markers and pathways**: Identifying differentially expressed genes and marker genes that are associated with specific cell types or disease states.

### 6. **Target of Analysis:**
   - The main objective is to perform **cell clustering**, identify **differentially expressed genes**, and perform **functional enrichment analysis** to understand the biological processes involved in lung cancer progression.

### 7. **Possible Applications:**
   - **Tumor microenvironment profiling**: Understanding the interaction between cancer cells and the immune system.
   - **Immunotherapy targets**: Identifying immune-related markers or immune cell subtypes that may be involved in the cancer response.
   - **Personalized medicine**: Analyzing gene expression patterns that could provide insights into prognosis, treatment response, or potential biomarkers for patient stratification.

This dataset can be crucial for revealing insights into lung cancer biology, aiding in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, and improving the understanding of the tumor microenvironment's complexity.
